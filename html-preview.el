;;; Dependencies:
;; Requires Emacs to be compiled with xwidgets support

;;; Commentary:

;; Provides `html-preview' which is a function to preview current file exported
;; inside Emacs. Uses xwidgets as opposed to `org-eww' which uses `eww' make
;; changes. This allows viewing Reveal.js presentations, for instance.
