* Dependencies
Requires Emacs to be compiled with xwidgets support

* Commentary

Provides ~html-preview~ which is a function to preview current file exported
inside Emacs. Uses xwidgets as opposed to ~org-eww~ which uses ~eww~ make
changes. This allows viewing Reveal.js presentations, for instance.

(require 'html-preview)
By default previews are generated only on save.
If you wish to enable previews for every change, set
~html-preview-after-change-idle-delay~ to some value in seconds.
(setq html-preview-after-change-idle-delay 0.4)
